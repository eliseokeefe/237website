This the README for the CSE237 Website. This is not the completed project, but the frontend that will be linked to a backend in the future. This website will be used in the course when students work on the final group project and will be linked through their GitHub accounts. The goal with this project was to create a simple UI that, when linked with a backend, can function to allow students to submit peer feedback and receive grades, as well as give the professor the ability assign groups and submit grades. 

237website.html & 237website.css are for the homepage. With a backend, it would be ideal for the student's grades to dynamically populate on the homepage after they login with GitHub.

237.js is the javascript for logging in with Github. This is not complete yet, but uses a similar structure to the 131 Website.

githublinks.html & githublinks.css are where the group repositories would appear for easy access during peer feedback. This could be imbedded using the GitHub API or just link.

groupforms.css & groupforms.html are where they can provide peer feedback. This will look similar to the group feedback forms, which does not exist yet but would use a nearly identical structure to the groupform page. On the backend, there needs to be a way to have the admin assign forms based on group pairings automatically, which can be linked to github accounts. 

login.css & login.html are the files for the Github login page 

admin.html, admin.css, and admin.js are the files containing the professor's side of the website, including submitting grades, changing groups, and form access. Form access should probably be time based but a toggle is avaliable if needed
