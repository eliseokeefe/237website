This the README for the CSE237 Website. This website will be used in the course when students work on group projects in order to submit peer feedback & receieve grades. This will be linked through their GitHub accounts. 
237website.html & 237website.css are for the homepage. With a backend, it would be ideal for the student's grades to dynamically populate on the homepage after they login with GitHub 
237.js is the javascript for logging in with Github. This is not complete yet, but uses a similar structure to the 131 Website
githublinks.html & githublinks.css are where the group repositories would appear for easy access during peer feedback. This could be imbedded using the GitHub API or just link
groupforms.css & groupforms.html are where they can provide peer feedback. This will look similar to the group feedback forms, but how many forms/who each form is for should dynamically popoulate for the Group Feedback Forms section, so there is currently no HTML for this, however it would be the same content as this page
login.css & login.html are the files for the Github login page 
admin.html, admin.css, and admin.js are the files containing the professor's side of the website, including submitting grades, changing groups, and form access. Form access should probably be time based but a toggle is avaliable if needed
